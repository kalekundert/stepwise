class Library:
    """
    Provide access to every protocol available to the user.

    The protocols are organized into "collections", which are groups of related 
    protocols.  Which collections are available to the user at any moment can 
    depend on factors such as the current working directory, the user's 
    configuration settings, which plugins are installed, whether the internet 
    is available, etc.

    The primary role of the library is to search through every available 
    collection for protocols matching a given "tag".  Tags are fuzzy patterns 
    meant to be succinct (i.e. easily typed on the command line) yet capable of 
    specifically identifying any protocol.  See `_match_tag()` for a complete 
    description of the tag syntax.

    Strictly speaking, collections are groups of "entries" rather than 
    protocols.  Entries are protocol factories.  For the example of a 
    collection representing a directory, each entry in that collection would 
    represent a file in that directory.  The actual protocol instances would 
    come from the entries either reading or executing those files.

    Collections and entries are intended to be highly polymorphic, so that many 
    different means of accessing protocols (e.g. files, plugins, network 
    drives, websites, etc.) can be supported.

def _match_tag(tag, name):
    """
    Indicate if the given tag matches the given name.

    The purpose of a tag is to succinctly identify a protocol by name.  A 
    protocol's name can be anything, but is generally something like a 
    filesystem path.  To be more specific, names have two parts:

    - The name of the collection containing the protocol.  If the collection is 
      a directory, this is the path to that directory.  If the collection is a 
      plugin, this is the name of the plugin.  Different kinds of collections 
      may have different naming conventions.

    - The name of the protocol within its collection.  Typically this is the 
      path to the protocol within the collection, although again, different 
      collections may have different naming conventions.

    A match is determined by splitting both the tag and the name into parts 
    delimited by `os.sep` (e.g. '/' on Unix systems).  Each part in the tag 
    must match a part in the name, and the last part in the tag must match the 
    last part of the name.  If the tag has multiple parts, the corresponding 
    parts of the name must appear in the same order (but not necessarily 
    consecutively).  Individual parts are matched using the `fnmatch` syntax, 
    e.g. '*' to match anything.  For convenience, '..' can be used instead of 
    '*', since '*' often needs to be escaped to avoid shell expansion.  Partial 
    matches are allowed, but full matches are preferred.

    Each successful match is given a score indicating how good the match is.  
    Everything else being equal, one match will score higher than another if:

    - More of the rightmost parts of the name are matched.  For example, 
      the tag 'a/b' matches '_/a/_/b' better than 'a/_/_/b', because the 'a' is 
      further to the right in the former name.

    - An individual part is matched better.  Best is if the whole part is 
      matched.  Second best is if the beginning of the part is matched.  Third 
      best is if the middle of the part is matched.  Worst is if the part isn't 
      matched.  For example, the tag `a` matches `a` better than `ab`, and `ab` 
      better than `ba`.

    Arguments:
        tag (str): The tag.  If `None`, every name will match.
        name (str): The name to compare the tag against.

    Returns:
        A score indicating whether the name matches the tag, and if so, how 
        good the match is.  The score object is not guaranteed to have any 
        particular type, but is guaranteed to have the following properties:

        - It will evaluate to `True` if there was a match and `False` 
          otherwise.

        - It will support the comparison operators, and the best match will 
          evaluate greater than any other match.
            
    Examples:
        >>> from stepwise import _match_tag
        >>> _match_tag('pcr', '/home/rfranklin/pcr')
        (3)
        >>> _match_tag('rf/pcr', '/home/rfranklin/pcr')

    - Put the desired arguments in `sys.argv`.
    - Set `__name__` to `'__main__'`.
    - Catch `SystemExit` exceptions.
    - Replace the stdout file descriptor with a pipe, so that we can read any 
      output generated by the script no matter how it's generated.
    - Replace the stdin file descriptor with an empty pipe, so that the script 
      read input on stdin that's meant for us.
