    # This is an interesting case.  The same reagent can only appear in two

    # one of the intermediate mixes.  In this case, we don't want to count the 
    # solvent when considering reagent order, because the master mix isn't 
    # really *providing* the solvent.  It's providing the non-shared reagent, 
    # so it should be slotted in at that point.
