# In order for coverage to work, the package needs to be installed in editable/
# symlink mode.  Unfortunately, this means we can't use pip to install the 
# package (as of version 19.2), because pip cannot use `pyproject.toml` for 
# editable installs.  Instead it requires `setup.py`, which we don't have.  
# This means we need to use `flit` directly to install the package.
